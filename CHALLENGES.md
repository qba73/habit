## Problems to solve

There's a surprising amount involved in what seems like a simple tool. You'll need to:

* Build a tool that can take command-line arguments

* Write tests for a program that prints to the terminal, without printing to the terminal

* Read data from a disk file or database, and update it as necessary

* Calculate time intervals so that you know whether to extend the current streak, or start a new one

* Make sure you don't extend the streak when the user performs the habit more than once on a given day
